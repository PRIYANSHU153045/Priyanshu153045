# Hii I'm Priyanshu Singh! 👋
# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! I'm  Priyanshu Singh, a passionate  DevSecOps engineer with deep expertise in AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and securing cloud-native environments. I specialize in building and managing scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure, ensuring that security is embedded into every step of the DevOps pipeline.

Currently, I am working at ICICI Lombard, where I focus on implementing best practices for cloud security and infrastructure automation.

## 🌟 Areas of Expertise

- AWS EKS: Designing, deploying, and managing Kubernetes clusters in AWS, including configuration, scaling, and monitoring.
- DevSecOps: Integrating security into the CI/CD pipeline, implementing automation for security scans, vulnerability management, and policy enforcement.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Writing infrastructure automation using tools like Terraform and **AWS CloudFormation to manage cloud resources in a reproducible and auditable way.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Building automated, secure pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI.
- Containerization & Orchestration: Expertise in Docker, Kubernetes, Helm charts, and managing microservices architecture.
- Cloud Security: Implementing security best practices for cloud environments, including IAM roles, secrets management, encryption, and compliance.
- Monitoring & Logging: Setting up robust monitoring solutions with Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch to gain insights into application and infrastructure performance.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- AWS Services: EKS, EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, RDS, Lambda, etc.
- Kubernetes & Docker: Kubernetes cluster management, Helm, Docker containers, Kubernetes networking, and monitoring.
- DevSecOps Tools:  Terraform.
- CI/CD & Automation: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions.
- Scripting & Programming: Python, Bash, YAML, JSON.
- Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, dynatrace, AWS CloudWatch.
- Version Control: Git, GitHub.

I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques to improve the security and performance of cloud-native applications. If you’re interested in any of the projects I’m working on, feel free to check out my repositories and contribute!
